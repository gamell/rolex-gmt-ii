[![rolex gif animation](https://github.com/gamell/rolex-gmt-ii/blob/master/media/rolex-gmt-ii.gif)](https://gamell.github.io/rolex-gmt-ii)

See it live [here](https://gamell.github.io/rolex-gmt-ii/rolex.html) or in this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/gamell/pen/ozkPLQ).

## Setup

`npm install`

## Build

`npm start` (which will run the local `webpack`)

## Chrome Extension

I also packaged this as a [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hchnfnfjjknanhhconaappneoejmgngi/). Here you can find the [source code (unpacked extension)](https://github.com/gamell/rolex-gmt-ii-chrome-ext).

## Thoughts

Yes, I know using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/usage.html) to bundle this project is way overkill but I wanted to learn how to use it, sorry :grin:
